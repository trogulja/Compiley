  - [x] handle automatic images
    - [x] set d_type 4 in first go (will be read from claro logs or assumed)
  - [x] handle cutout images
    - [x] solve duration for cutout images
    - [x] d_type = 0 (read from source)
  - [x] end of file db housekeeping
    - [x] reduce jobsAtomic by day / job / source / type / user into job
    - [x] insert new jobs, get id
    - [x] update jobsAtomic with valid id, insert into db
- [x] parseClaroManual
  - [x] write results to helperClaro table

  - [ ] helperClaro match with jobs EasyJob
  - [ ] days summify
    - [ ] worktime vs jobs adjust assumed time per day
    - [ ] resummify days
    - [ ] report problem inputs
      - [ ] ignore first in month double inputs
